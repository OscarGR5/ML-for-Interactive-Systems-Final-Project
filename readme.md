### Introduction
This project explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in gaming, focusing on developing a Rock Paper Scissors game using gesture recognition for user interaction. The primary aim is to utilize HandPoseOSC for gesture recognition, enhancing player interaction.

### Objectives
- Develop a Rock Paper Scissors game with gesture recognition.
- Choose an appropriate ML algorithm.
- Effective training and feature extraction.
- Design interactive gameplay.

### Research: AI & ML in Gaming
AI in gaming has evolved from rule-based systems to machine learning techniques, enhancing NPC behavior and player experiences. Reinforcement learning (RL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are prominent in this field, enabling dynamic and immersive gameplay.

### Gesture Recognition Techniques
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Effective for analyzing spatial relationships in image data, ideal for capturing hand gestures.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):** Simple and efficient for real-time gesture recognition tasks.

### Tools Used
- **Wekinator:** A machine learning tool for creating interactive systems.
- **HandPoseOSC:** A tool for real-time hand gesture recognition.
- **Python:** Used for developing the game logic, UI and integrating the tools.
